# Bookworm Vision Statement

The book-ordering system (Bookworm) will allow customers to discover and purchase new and bestselling books, as well as sell their previously owned books regardless of their location

Similar to shopping in a physical bookstore, customers will be able to browse from an extensive selection of books covering a wide range of topics. However, unlike most physical bookstores, Bookworm will provide helpful suggestions from its exclusive ‘shop assistant’ book recommendation service as well as provide an outlet for customers to sell their gently used books.

Bookworm is primarily designed for a wide range of customers such as students, lecturers, professionals and even regular book lovers. While customers will require an account to completely access the full extent of  Bookworm’s features, they will not require one to browse lists of the most popular books or to preview each book briefly. 

Bookworm account holders will be able to order any number of books at once with a wide range of payment methods available for the customer, with the use of prepaid credit making the payment process nearly effortless as the customer won’t need to tediously enter payment information every time they want to buy a book. Customers will also be able to leave comments or reviews for any books they have purchased, so as to provide a valuable reference for future customers. 

A platform for trading second-hand books will be available. The service will be primarily targeted towards students who wish to quickly and easily sell their used textbooks, but the service is open to all customers who wish to sell their used books in a convenient manner. 

The process of browsing books on Bookworm will be faster and more efficient than browsing books in a physical store as customers will be able to easily locate a wide selection of books using the book location service which allows the customer to look up books using the title, author's name or book genres. Bookworm will also offer a range of pricing options for select books, with brand new or pre-owned copies available for purchase.

Although there are many physical bookstores in the world, the employees present in these stores may not be multilingual, and might not understand what the customer is looking for. Bookworm however will be available in multiple languages and will maintain a history of the customers purchases and previously read books, allowing for precise book recommendations. 

With the popularity of digital books these days, many people prefer digital books over physical printed books. Consequently, Digital versions of books will also be available to Bookworm customers for purchasing and reading on a wide range of devices, from cellphones to home computers, making it easier than ever before to purchase a book and start reading almost immediately.

The project will be considered successful based on three criteria. First, if Bookworm helps the customer reduce their time spent finding books of interest by a significant amount (greater than 20%). Second, if the total books sold meets or exceeds 2000 in the first month. Finally, if the average percentage of purchases made by each customer from the recommended books list comprises at least 25% of their total purchases.

Create an ARCHITECTURE.md file that describes the architecture of your application. Identify the packages and major source code files in your repository. Sketch out the overall architecture of your system broadly. If you want, you can use a tool like asciiflow for text purity in your ARCHITECTURE.md file, or you may create an architecture diagram as an image (.png, .jpg, .svg).
